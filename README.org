#+DESCRIPTION: More extensions for emacs jupyter package
#+created: April 01, 2024

A extension package for [[https://github.com/emacs-jupyter/jupyter][jupyter]], which rewrite some functions in
=jupyter-org-extensions.el= with more modern packages (like =transient= and
=consult= etc).

* Intro
1. Why not an extension to org mode?

   Keybindings in this package do actually not restrict to, but it invoke many
   useful functions in =jupyter=. And if one need key menus to navigate between
   blocks, it will be much possible in jupyter session.

* Features
1. transient navigation panel
2. jump src block with =consult=

* TODOs
1. [ ] display ansi color of src block result
2. [ ] better =jupyter-org--annotate=
3. [ ] better src block header editing
4. [ ] also kill header line when =jupyter-org-kill-block-and-results=
5. [ ] add grouping and narrowing to =jupyter-org-consult-block=
   maybe by src block language and ~:result~ keyword
6. [ ] highlight current selected
7. [ ] center after navigation
